 # Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) by utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze both structured and unstructured CVD-related data.

### Research Objectives

This project focuses on addressing two key research objectives related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction.

#### **1. Can we accurately predict the presence of cardiovascular disease based on given features?**

The primary goal of this research is to determine if machine learning models can effectively identify whether a person has cardiovascular disease using various health-related features. These features may include:

- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, etc.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking status, physical activity levels, and alcohol consumption.
- **Medical History**: Information about pre-existing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or previous heart-related issues.
- **Clinical Measurements**: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI), etc.

The focus is on building and validating a predictive model that can take these inputs and classify a person as either "having CVD" or "not having CVD" with a high degree of accuracy. By comparing multiple algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, this research aims to identify the most reliable and interpretable model for CVD prediction.

Key steps in achieving this objective:
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset with comprehensive and labeled CVD-related records.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, normalize values, and remove outliers to ensure the quality of the inputs.
3. **Feature Selection**: Analyze which variables are most relevant for prediction.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Test different algorithms and use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate their performance.

#### **2. What are the most important features contributing towards CVD prediction?**

The second objective is to identify the specific features that have the most significant impact on the prediction of cardiovascular disease. This involves understanding which variables are consistently associated with an increased or decreased risk of CVD. For instance:

- **Are high cholesterol levels more influential than high blood pressure?**
- **How does age contribute to the risk compared to lifestyle factors like smoking?**

Understanding feature importance not only improves the model's interpretability but also offers valuable knowledge for medical practitioners to focus on the most critical risk factors during diagnosis and treatment.

### Significance of These Objectives
- **For Healthcare**: Accurate prediction models and feature importance insights can guide doctors in early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
- **For Preventive Measures**: Public health initiatives can target the most critical risk factors identified in the study.
- **For Future Research**: Insights gained can contribute to the development of more advanced, domain-specific models or datasets for cardiovascular disease studies. 

By addressing these objectives, the project seeks to provide actionable, data-driven tools and insights for combating cardiovascular diseases more effectively.
